Having recently switched these pages over to [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), I was keen to see how easy it was to build interactive pages. Support for [Observable](https://observablehq.com/) comes out of the box for JS people, but I was also thrilled to discover the extension [quarto-pyodide](https://quarto.thecoatlessprofessor.com/pyodide/) which makes it easy to incorporate [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/) – aka Python in the browser – into Quarto projects.

This is a Pyodide-enabled code cell in a Quarto HTML document.

```{pyodide-python}
n = 5
while n > 0:
  print(n)
  n = n - 1

print('Blastoff!')
```
